# Graduate Onboarding Project

Welcome to Knowit! 

This project is designed to provide you with hands-on experience in both backend and frontend development, using technologies commonly found in the industry. By the end of this project, you'll have gained valuable skills that will serve as a solid foundation for your future endeavors in software development.

**Project Description:**

The Stop Smoking Website is a web application designed to assist users to quit smoking and it consists of three main components:

1. **Backend API (API folder):** Developed in .NET, this is the backbone of our application, handling data management and serving endpoints for frontend interaction.

2. **Frontend (Frontend folder):** Built with Vue.js, the frontend is responsible for the user interface and interaction with the backend API. It provides a user-friendly experience for individuals visiting our website.

3. **Data (Data folder):** This folder contains initial data that needs to be populated into the SQLite database. It includes essential information required for the application to function correctly.

**Project Goals:**

- Gain practical experience in backend and frontend development.
- Understand the interaction between frontend and backend components.
- Learn to work with a relational database (SQLite).
- Collaborate effectively within a team environment.
- Deliver a functional web application that assists individuals in quitting smoking.

**Requirements:**

Before diving into the project, it's recommended that you have the following prerequisites:

- Basic knowledge of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
- Familiarity with Vue.js for frontend development.
- Understanding of C# and .NET framework for backend development.
- Experience with version control systems, preferably Git.
- A development environment set up with necessary tools like Visual Studio Code, .NET SDK, and Node.js.

**Getting Started:**

Setting up your development environment is the first step towards contributing to the Stop Smoking Website project. Follow these instructions to ensure you have all the necessary tools and configurations in place.

**1. Install Required Software:**

- **Visual Studio Code:** Download and install Visual Studio Code, You can download it from [here](https://code.visualstudio.com/).

- **Node.js:** Install Node.js, a JavaScript runtime, which includes npm (Node Package Manager) for managing project dependencies. You can download it from [here](https://nodejs.org/).

- **Git:** Install Git, you can download it from [here](https://git-scm.com/).
  
- **SQLite** You can download it from [here](https://www.sqlite.org/)

- **Database viewer** You can choose which one you prefer better [SQLiteStudio](https://sqlitestudio.pl/) or [DBeaver](https://dbeaver.io/)

Go to your GitHub account and click on the "New" button to create a new repository. Give your repository a name and optionally add a description. You will push your changes to your own repository as you work on the project.

**4. When working together:**

- **Branching Model:**
  - Create feature branches for each new feature or task, ensuring isolation of changes and facilitating parallel development.
  - Regularly merge feature branches into the main branch (often named `main` or `master`) to integrate changes.

- **Collaborative Workflow:**
  - Communicate effectively with your team members to coordinate efforts and avoid conflicts.
  - Assign tasks and responsibilities using GitHub Issues or Jira to track progress and manage work items.
  - Review each other's code using pull requests (PRs) to maintain code quality and ensure adherence to project standards.
  - Use PR templates to provide context and guidelines for reviewers.

- **Documentation and Collaboration Tools:**
  - Maintain comprehensive documentation within the repository to facilitate onboarding and knowledge sharing.
  - Utilize collaboration tools such as GitHub Wiki, README files, and inline code comments to document project guidelines, architecture, and implementation details.
